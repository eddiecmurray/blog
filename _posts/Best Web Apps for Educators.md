## Multimedia

[AudioMass](https://audiomass.co/) is a free open source audio editor that teachers and students can use to record and edit audio.  This can be used to help students practice speaking in foriegn languages, to record read alouds, or to record podcasts.

[AutoDraw](https://www.autodraw.com/) is created by Google and helps users create drawings.  The tool uses artifical intelligence to determine what you are drawing.  The final drawing can be saved to your computer.  This is a great tool to help students create multimedia for projects.  I have used it my computer programming class to have students create sprites they can use in their Scratch projects.
