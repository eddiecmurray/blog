> The Internet Archive calls this new collection the [Calculator Drawer](https://archive.org/details/calculatordrawer). There are 14 calculators to choose from, including the HP 48GX, TI-82, TI-83 Plus, and even the Electronic Number Muncher, which is an 80s-era toy calculator. The Internet Archive doesnâ€™t just emulate the interface of each device, either; it incorporates their physical design and buttons, making it feel like you have the actual device right in front of you.

This group of calculators is very useful for teachers and students because they can be accessed on any device with a web browser.  These caclulators can also be embedded on a web page.  Below is an embed of the TI-83 Plus:
