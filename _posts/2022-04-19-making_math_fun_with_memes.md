[Alexander King](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandra-king-23141419) at [Edutopia](https://www.edutopia.org/) explains how she [adapted a math meme contest for her high school calculus class](https://www.edutopia.org/article/fun-activity-promote-sense-belonging-high-school-math):

>[S]tudents can participate in the same activity that organizers of the Southeastern Section of the Mathematical Association of America annual meeting in March 2020 created to preserve community spirit when their in-person meeting was canceled because of Covid restrictions: Make a math cartoon/meme contest.
>
>The rules were simple: Create a fun mathematical image. The task was [introduced by Ben Orlin](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kvkNBagS2XlrNHLl7yoDBFuNB7YNf1ZJ/view) of the [Math with Bad Drawings](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/) blog. In short, it required creating a playful image that had to do with mathematics—research, teaching, concepts, culture, ideas, applications, etc.—without worrying about being side-splitting funny. After all, Orlin explained, the audience was an audience of mathematicians, who share similar sensibilities.
