## Planning Instruction

Julie Mason at [We Are Teachers](https://www.weareteachers.com/) talks about how [How Teachers Can Plan & Use Virtual “Stations” Online](https://www.weareteachers.com/virtual-stations/):

> There’s a reason why so many teachers use this instructional model. First, it allows us to use data to strategically group students and differentiate their instruction. Second, teachers can teach and reteach small groups, which allows for more guidance and feedback. Finally, students practice a skill in different ways (on their own, with their peers, and with their teacher), which is engaging and supports different learning preferences. I could go on, and on. There are so many benefits. 

[Catlin Tucker](https://twitter.com/Catlin_Tucker) talks about how to build activities for online and offline learners in her blog post [The Building Blocks of an Online Lesson](https://catlintucker.com/2020/05/building-blocks-of-an-online-lesson/)

> This template also encourages teachers to think about pairing online and offline options to give students a degree of choice. There may not be an “offline option” for every activity, but questioning whether or not students can complete a task offline is a habit worth cultivating in this time of distance learning.
