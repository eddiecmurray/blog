I've been working recently with teachers on incorporating more blended learning strategies into their classroom instruction.  This includes small group instruction, student paced learning, and an increase in instructional technology usage.  With all of these different types of learning activities taking place at the same time the classroom can become very busy.  It is important to have good systems in place and effective classroom management to ensure the classroom is functioning correctly.

Some students are very comfortable with the traditional model of classroom instruction.  [Julie Daniel Davis](https://twitter.com/juliedavisEDU) [explains in a post on Ditch That Textbook](http://ditchthattextbook.com/10-keys-to-success-in-blended-learning/) explains:

>I am amazed at how hard it has been for some of the students to unlearn the “sit and get” way of instruction they have been accustomed to.

It may take several lessons before students adapt to this new way of instruction.  Blended learning involves more accountability on the students part as the work independently.  For students who are struggling it may help to have a teacher station where you go through the activities with a particular group of students who need more support.

An important pat of setting up a blended learning classroom is developing the systems and structures.  [Sarah Rich](https://twitter.com/edtechSAE) talks about [why it is important to develop routines with technology in your classroom](https://tenmarks.typepad.com/tenmarks/2016/08/7-steps-to-set-up-your-classroom-for-blended-learning.html):

> Do not be tempted to rush through the implementation of these routines at the beginning of the year. Invest the time in establishing procedures now so that the rest of the year will run smoothly. And it is essential to review the procedures frequently to keep it fresh.

Teachers typically share and recieve content from students using a learning management system.  When you start to use a leanring management system it is important to demonstrate and practice how to access and submit content with students.  I typically start with a low stakes assignment so that students can focus on learning how to use the LMS rather than trying to learn the LMS and new content at the same time.  This helps to not overwhelm students with too many new things at once.

Consistency is important as well.  Again, Julie Daniel Davis discusses [why teachers should use the same vocabulary and icons during lessons](http://ditchthattextbook.com/10-keys-to-success-in-blended-learning/):

>So keeping things visually
>consistent. For instance, we have the following icons hanging from the ceilings or on desk
>groupings, as well as placed as a guide for where each student is to start each day.

This is important while explaining what students should be doing.  Don't switch between "sign in" and "log in" or "shutdown" and "log off".  Make sure you stay consistent with written and oral directions you provide to students.

Sarah Rich also discusses why it is improtant to balance the use of technology in the classroom:

> [H]ands on activities are essential to allow students to learn using different modalities and to support all learners. I try to incorporate a wide variety of activities to allow for balance even in a Blended Learning Classroom.

Not every activity has to use technology.  The use of technology should be purposeful and allow students to do something they weren't able to do before.

Also, you may not need a full computer cart to facilitate a blended learning classroom because not every student will need a device at each station or for each activity.  [Anita Townsend](https://twitter.com/anitatownsend0) discusses this [in a post on Teach Magazine](https://teachmag.com/archives/3574):

>All of your students do not need access to devices all the time. Plan and be specific
>about what you want the students to use the technology for. What learning goals does
>the technology support? What is the best technology for specific learning tasks?
