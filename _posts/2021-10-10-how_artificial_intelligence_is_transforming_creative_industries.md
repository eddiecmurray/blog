[Vergecast](https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast) just finished a short series on artificial intelligence (AI).  The series focuses on how AI is having a significant impact on the way content is being created for voice, video, writing, and taste.

In terms of voice, [AI is being used to create clones of peoples voices](https://www.theverge.com/22672123/ai-voice-clone-synthesis-deepfake-applications-vergecast).  For instance, celebrities often have to record commercials for radio stations across the country.  Another example is creating content with peoples voice in other languages.  Think about how far reaching a podcast or movie could be if the original actor / speaker could be heard in the other language using AI.

There are also ways bad actors could abuse this technology.  Imagine a bad actor using your posts on social media to generate an AI voice for you and targeting people you know or institutions you use.  Some companies have said their software will use a digital watermark that will indicate it is a voice AI.  Still, this will be challenging to regulate as the technology moves faster than legislation.

In the realm of video, AI is being used to streamline the creation of video content.
