I am a bit of a productivity geek.  It is really interesting to find a new life hack that improves my day to day productivity and I like reading about how other people stay productive.  Some of my favorite weekly articles are [Lifehacker's How I Work](https://lifehacker.com/c/how-i-work), [Use This](https://usesthis.com/), and [What's in My Bag?]([https://www.getrevue.co/profile/wimb?utm_campaign=Issue&utm_content=profilename&utm_medium=email&utm_source=What%27s+in+my+bag%3F](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/wimb?utm_campaign=Issue&utm_content=profilename&utm_medium=email&utm_source=What's+in+my+bag%3F)).  Along those themes I wanted to start documenting the tools I use to get things done and see how they change from year to year.  So these are the products and services that help me stay productive.

## What hardware do you use?

My phone is the [OnePlus 5T](https://www.oneplus.com/support/spec/oneplus-5t) whith 8 GB RAM and 128 GB storage.  I consider this to be my primary device because I use it every single day.  There are days that go by where I don't use my desktop and latop below.  The OnePlus 5T is a couple of years old but the battery life and performance are still fantastic.  

At home I have a custom desktop computer that I built about 10 years ago.  It has a Quad-core 3.2 Ghz AMD processor with 8 GB RAM.  At the time I built the computer it was a pretty powerful machine and ten years later it still gets everything I need to done (web browsing, document editing, music, [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) server, and light video editing with [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html)).  I added some hard drives to it over the years and the first one just failed on me a few months ago.  

At work I use a [2017 13-inch Macbook Pro with Touchbar](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-3.1-13-mid-2017-retina-display-touch-bar-specs.html).  It has a Core i5 and 16 GB RAM which is plenty for the work I do on it.  People always ask about the Touch Bar.  I don't use it much and would be fine without the Touch Bar.  I also use an old [4th generation iPad](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipad/specs/apple-ipad-a1458-4th-gen-late-2012-wi-fi-only-specs.html).  It is stuck on iOS 10.3.3 but I primarily use it as a second monitor on my MacBook.  

As for the accessories, I use a [Logitech K800 wireless keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Keyboard-Control-Touchpad/dp/B014EUQOGK_) often when I do presentations or workshops.  I've had the same one for over 5 years and just had to change the batteries.  I recently purchased a [Fuse Reel The Side Winder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BB7X88Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for cable management on my MacBook Pro.  It has been fantastic.  I have the [Plantronics BackBeat FIT 2100 Wireless Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-BackBeat-Headphones-Sweatproof-Waterproof/dp/B07FTJVZC1) for when I run/workout at the gym and they are first bluetooth gym headphones to not die on me in under a year.  I also have a [Garmin Forerunner 25](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-25-Large-Black/dp/B013GVDTI4) to log my runs.

## And what software?

The most important thing to me with software is the ability to work across platforms (Windows, macOS, Android, and Web) as well as the ability to export my data.  If the software doesn't have those features I am very hesitant to use it.

On the Windows desktop I use [Storage Spaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/overview) for a software based RAID.  I've been using it for over 5 years and haven't had any problems.  I use Storage Spaces for my [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) server.  It is nice to have a backup for all the media I've had since high school / college.  On the Mac, I user [Noti](https://noti.center/) for [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/) notications and [Spectacles](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) for window management.  On Android, I use [Fenix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.mvilla.android.fenix2&hl=en_US) for Twitter, [KeePass2Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android&hl=en_US), [Microsoft Outlook](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.outlook&hl=en_US) for my work email and my calendars (I always seem to have sync issues with Google Calendar and Office 365), and [Solid Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2&hl=en_US).  On the iPad, the only thing I use it for is a secondary display for my MacBook Pro with [Duet](https://www.duetdisplay.com/).  The iPad is too slow to get any work done but works great as a secondary display.

Cross platform apps/services I use include [Microsoft Outlook](https://products.office.com/en-ww/outlook/email-and-calendar-software-microsoft-outlook), [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), [Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/), [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) (this is what I use for all of my doument backups), [Google Photos](https://www.google.com/photos/about/) (full resolution backups), [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/), [Chrome Remote Desktop](https://remotedesktop.google.com/), [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/), [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/), [Authy](https://authy.com/), [Typora](https://www.typora.io/), [KeeWeb](https://keeweb.info/) (Windows, Mac), [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html), [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html), [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), [Nuzzel](https://developers.nuzzel.com/), [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), [Buffer](https://buffer.com/), [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/), and [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/).

Two new additions to my workflow are [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/) and [Dropbox Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/paper).  I have been a Wunderlist user for years but Microsoft has [notfied users the product will be sunset soon](https://www.wunderlist.com/blog/join-us-on-our-new-journey/) so I made the switch to To Do.  The only thing I miss is the Wunderlist browser extension; there is no browser extension for To Do.  When I see a website I want to check at a specific date/time I usually add it to To Do but I can't do that on my desktop browser.  (As a workaround I'll use Chrome's send to device feature then use the To Do mobile app).  I also started to use Dropbox Paper for notetaking.  I really have grown fond of markdown since I started this blog about a year ago.  Markdown is very simple and clean to use.  Dropbox Paper essenitally uses markdown for the formatting and also allows you to embed multimedia easily.  I wish it was a little more open with uploading a markdown file to the service but overall I really like it.

## What would your dream setup be?

I would like a phone that is officially waterprof and has wireless charging.  I won't upgrade until a phone offers those features for an affordable price.  Also, I'm still looking for a mardown editor as good as Typora on Android.  I haven't found anything similiar which is why I use Dropbox Paper for my notes.  The Garmin Forrunner 25 is great and when it eventually stops working (I've had it for about 5 years) I'm looking forward to upgrading to a watch with more bells and whistles.
