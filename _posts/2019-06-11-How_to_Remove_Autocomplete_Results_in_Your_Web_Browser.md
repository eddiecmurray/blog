Have you ever typed too quickly or thought you hit TAB on your keyboard to then look up and see your username and password in the same dialogue box?  Now every time you try to login you see your username followed by the password in the autocomplete results of your web browser.  Lifehacker has created a useful set of instructions on [how to delete these autocomplete results from the web browser](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-delete-annoying-autofill-entries-in-your-browser-1828635913/amp).

If you use Google Chrome you can use the directions below:

>Start typing in a website’s address. When your browser begins to auto-populate the wrong address in Chrome’s address bar, hold down Shift and Function on a Mac—or just Shift on Windows—and tap the Delete key. Once you see a website highlighted, you can also tap the up and down arrows on your keyboard to pull up any proposed result to delete it. It’s as easy as that—and a lot more convenient than clearing your entire history.

If you don’t use Chrome, Lifehacker included directions on how to remove the autocomplete results from Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safair.
