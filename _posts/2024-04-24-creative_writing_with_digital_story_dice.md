>Dave Birss created a [digital story dice generator](https://davebirss.com/storydice/). The dice feature different images, with over 50 options for each dice. You have the option of choosing five dice or nine dice. This is a handy tool if you are looking for inspiration to create fun story ideas.

A fun and easy way to spark creativity, the digital story dice generator is also a great example of a simple web app that students can develop in a computer science class.
