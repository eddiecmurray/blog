[Ian Byrd](https://twitter.com/ianabyrd) has developed an interactive tool to help educators create clear and measurable lesson objectives called [The Differentiator](https://www.byrdseed.com/differentiator/#):

>The Differentiator is based on Bloom's Taxonomy, Kaplan and Gould's [Depth and Complexity](https://www.byrdseed.com/introducing-depth-and-complexity/), and David Chung's [product menu](https://sites.google.com/site/davidnchung/presentationoptions).
