Iâ€™ve always preferred using laptops in the classroom instead of having desktops or using a computer lab with desktops.  The laptops allow more flexibility with creating small groups and adapting the classroom for different types of activities.  One of the issues with laptops is right clicking on the trackpad.  Here is how students (and teachers) can easily right click on a laptop trackpad.

There are a few different ways you can right click on a laptop trackpad.  Some laptop trackpads allow you to right click by clicking on the lower right hand corner of the trackpad.  On multi touch trackpads you can also use two fingers to view the right click menu.

An easy way to right click that works on most laptops is to use the Alt key on the keyboard (control on Mac) and then clicking on the trackpad.  Students (and teachers) may find this to be the easiest because it works the same across different types of laptops including Chromebooks, Windows, and Macs.

While laptops do offer flexibility in the classroom students may have difficulty bringing up the right click menu using the trackpad.  These tips will help students access the right click menu on their laptop.
