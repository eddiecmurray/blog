Ice breakers questions are a great activity to help students and teachers get to know each other and build community in the classroom.  If students do not feel comfortable with their peers then they are less likely to participate in classroom activities.  I also often use ice breaker activities at the beginning of professional development or PLC activities as a way to learn more about the participants and help people make connections.  These activities can also be used for hybrid and online learning with tools like Flipgrid.  Here are some resources to help you find ice breaker questions for your classroom
