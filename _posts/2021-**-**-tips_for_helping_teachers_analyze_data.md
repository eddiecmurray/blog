## Facilitating Data Discussions

[Ashley Taplin](https://twitter.com/AshleyPTaplin) discuss several strategies for [facilitating a data discussion](https://ashleytaplin.com/2021/01/15/facilitating-a-virtual-data-discussion/) using Google Jamboard.  Taplin explains the importance of data discussions, suggests protocols to facilitate the discussions, and models how to use Google Jamboard to facilitate this discussion:

> We needed to find ways to make the discussion meaningful and relevant, celebrate successes, and also help teachers uncover actionable steps in further improving student achievement. Keeping these needs in mind, we developed a process that merged together three protocols (“Notice and Wonder,” “Fishbone,” and “What-So What-Now What”) and led to a rich discussion through a collaborative, virtual structure using Zoom and Jamboard.
