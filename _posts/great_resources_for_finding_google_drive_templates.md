Google Drive is a great tool to help students and teachers create digital projects. Google Docs, Slides, Sheets, and Drawings all work across different devices, allows for real-time collaboration, and make it easy to share documents between teachers and students.  There are many innovative examples of how teachers are using these tools with their students.  Here are some great templates teachers have shared that you can use with your own classes.
