The station rotation model is a great way to plan learning activities that allows students to work in small groups collaboratively or independently.  It also allows the teacher to work with a small group of students to provide personalized feedback.  For classroom that have limited access to technology teachers can design one or more stations as an online station for personalized instruction or collaborative activities.  [Caitlin Tucker]( https://twitter.com/Catlin_Tucker) provides a variety of resources on [her blog]( https://catlintucker.com/) to help teachers get started planning and facilitating station rotation activities in their classroom.

[Tucker provides a definition](https://catlintucker.com/2015/07/creating-small-learning-communities-with-the-station-rotation-model/) of what the station rotation model looks like in a blended learning classroom:

> The Station Rotation Model does exactly what the name suggests–students rotate through learning stations either on a fixed schedule or at the teacher’s discretion. At least one of the stations must be an online learning station for this to be considered a blended learning model. 

When discussing the use of educational technology it is important for teachers to understand that not every learning activity requires the use of technology.  In fact, there are some activities where the technology just gets in the way and makes learning more complicated.  The station rotation model allows teachers to incorporate technology when it is necessary.  The use of technology should provide students with opportunities for learning, collaboration, and creation that were not possible without the technology.  

The station rotation model allows more flexibility from the teach because they can work with small groups of students and circulate throughout the classroom to help students complete the activities.  This requires a significant amount of planning time from the teacher to design and create the resources necessary for each station.  For your offline, online, and teacher led activities [Tucker suggests asking these questions]( https://catlintucker.com/2015/07/creating-small-learning-communities-with-the-station-rotation-model/) as you design the stations:

> - What is the objective of each station? Will students produce something?
> - How much time do students need in each station? How long will they have to transition between stations?
> - What materials do they need in each station? How many devices are needed for the online learning stations? Do they need any special programs, apps, or software?
> - What will be the cue for them to transition to the next station?
> - Will directions be frontloaded, provided in written form at each station, or presented via mini-video tutorial at each station?

Tucker discusses how many teachers believe that the teacher led stations must be used for direct instruction.  While the teacher led station can be used for direction instruction [there are several other ways to utilize this small group time with students](https://catlintucker.com/2019/01/5-ways-to-design-your-teacher-led-station/).  Some of these learning activities include:

> 1. Hook the group
> 2. I do, we do, you do
> 3. Homework check and review
> 4. Real-time feedback
> 5. Quick assessment and individualized support

The "I Do, We Do, You Do" is a personal favorite for the teacher led station.  This explicit instructional strategy allows students to see an example of the problem by the teacher, work collaboratively on a different problem, and then work independently to solve their own problem.

If you are interested in other activities for offline, online, and teacher led stations [Tucker provides several examples](https://catlintucker.com/2019/10/english-station-rotation/) in the Google Doc below:

The station rotation model is an effective way to plan several small group activities that blended with online and offline activities.  It also allows teachers to work with small groups of students in a teacher led station to provide personalized feedback.
