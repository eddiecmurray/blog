Recently I was working with a class and a teacher recorded several sample videos on their iPhone for students to use in a video project.  By default, the iPhone uses a compressed format to save space on the device which isn't always compatible with other tools.  Here are directions on how to turn off that setting and use the more widely used JPG and MP4 media formats.

The iPhone uses High Efficiency Image Format (HEIF) and High Efficiency Video Format (HEVC) when you take pictures and videos to save space on the device.  This is great if you are looking to save space on your device but if you need to use that media with other tools or services then you may have a problem.

> Go to Settings > Camera > Format and select Most Compatible instead of High Efficiency.

Any photos you take moving forward will use the JPG and MP4 format which will work better with other editing tools.
