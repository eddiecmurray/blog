K12 Six has a [K-12 cyber incident map](https://k12cybersecure.com/map/) that details different levels of security breaches at schools going back to 2016.  As of February 11, 2021 there have been 1180 cyber incidents.  The incidents on the map include unauthorized disclosures, breaches or hacks, ransomware attacks, phishing attacks, and denial-of-service attacks.  The K12 Six website also includes a [video playlist of news reports](https://k12cybersecure.com/map/news-reports/) about the cyber attacks.  This is a great way to raise awareness at schools about the severity, frequency, and impact of cyber attacks on schools.  It also helps to facilitate conversations with educators about how they can protect themselves as well as their students from cyber incidents.
