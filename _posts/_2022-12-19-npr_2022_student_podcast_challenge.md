Authentic audiences are crucial for student projects because they provide a sense of purpose and relevance beyond just completing an assignment for a grade. When students know that their work will be seen and potentially used by a real-world audience, they are more motivated to put effort and thought into their project. Authentic audiences also give students the opportunity to practice communication and collaboration skills as they tailor their work to meet the needs and expectations of a specific group.

If you are looking for an authentic audience for a student project NPR has just announced the 2023 Student Podcast Challenge.  The content will start on January 6, 2023 and close on April 28.  The focus of the challenge is for students to create a podcast about any topic they wish to explore.
