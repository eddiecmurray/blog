[Out of the Box Media Literacy Initiative](https://www.ootbmedialiteracy.org/about-us/) has an [entire curriculum to support media literacy](https://www.ootbmedialiteracy.org/iwasfake-teachers-guide/).  One of the performance tasks for the units [focuses on evaluating if the claim in a meme is accurate](https://www.ootbmedialiteracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IWASFAKE-Performance-Task-2-Memes4News.pdf).

>Today, some people take memes as their sources of news. As ridiculous as it is, this seems to be the rule in the post-truth era: “If it seems to be true, it must be true.” This is a very dangerous premise why “fake news” spread so easily and so widely today. Whether a meme is well edited or poorly edited does not matter; these fabricated and manipulated content rely on their emotional load. Memes, after all, are designed to be funny, sarcastic, or provoking--not be instructional or informative.
