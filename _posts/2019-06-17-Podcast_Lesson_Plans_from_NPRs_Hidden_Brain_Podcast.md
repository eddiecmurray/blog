[As I have discussed](https://www.eddiecmurray.com/blog/2018/12/14/listenwise_curates_educational_podcasts_for_teachers/), the use of podcasts in the classroom has continued to rise in popularity during the past few years.  Many podcasts offer a transcript which allows students to read along as they listen.  [NPRâ€™s Hidden Brain podcast](https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain) includes many episodes that teachers can use in their classroom and they have now started to [provide study guides for some of their episodes](https://www.npr.org/2017/03/27/518822674/hidden-brain-study-guides-beta).

>To foster even more learning, we've created a series of study guides based on selected episodes of Hidden Brain. These guides are designed to supplement teachers' existing curricula, and have been tailored to serve a range of different learning levels, from middle school to high school to college. Whether you're teaching a sixth grade social studies class or an undergraduate seminar in psychology, we hope you'll find the materials below to be topical and age-appropriate.

The study guides include guiding questions teachers can use as students listen to the podcast and read along to the transcripts.  These are great resources to introduce a topic or analyze and evaluate the information in a podcasts after students have learned about the topic.
