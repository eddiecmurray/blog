[EdPuzzle](https://edpuzzle.com/) is a great tool to embed assessment questions into videos.  The ability to sync classes from Google Classroom also makes it easy for students to sign in and complete assignments.  This week a teacher asked how to use EdPuzzle to structure whole class discussion without having to select or submit a response to a question.  So let's look at how to use the comments feature to facilitate questions during whole class discussion.

There are three different types of prompts you can use in EdPuzzle: multiple choice, short answer, and comments.  With the comment prompt the video will stop and remind me what I wanted to review with students at that point in the video.  The image below demonstrates how to use the comments feature.

I often use the comments feature to remind myself to ask specific questions during certain parts of the video.  This helps when I am multitasking to answer a student's questions or helping an individual student in the class.
