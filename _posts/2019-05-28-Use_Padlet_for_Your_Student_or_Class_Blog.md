There are many student blogging tools for teachers to use but the setup process for some of these tools can be intimidating.  [Nathan Hall](http://twitter.com/nathanghall) talks about how teachers should consider using [Padlet](https://padlet.com/) as a class or student blogging tool.

>There are a number of blogging platforms out there, but only a handful that are specifically for classroom use. One option that often gets overlooked is to use Padlet for student blogging. It is simple to set up, has lots of options, and looks great!

Padlet is a great option for teachers looking for a dead simple blogging tool.  One issue with using Padlet is that students are posting anonymously on the blog (you can turn on moderation, but you wouldn’t know who made the post).  While the teacher can instruct students to add their name to the post some students may get “creative” with their posts and names.  You can have students create a Padlet account and share the board you created with them but this may be time consuming for teachers with large or multiple classes.
