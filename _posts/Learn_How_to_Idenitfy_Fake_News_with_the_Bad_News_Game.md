There are lots of great resources to teach kids of all ages about digital citizenship including free lessons from [BrainPop](https://www.brainpop.com/digitalcitizenship/), [Common Sense Media](https://www.commonsense.org/education/digital-citizenship), and [Google](https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us).  An important aspect of digital citizenship is being able to identify biased or false information.  [Bad News](https://getbadnews.com/droggame_book/junior-uk/#intro) is a new web-based game to help students learn about and develop strategies for identifying fake news.

In the Bad News game students assume the role of a journalist / social media influencer and attempt to spread disinformation to others.  This game exposes students to the ways disinformation and fake news is spread online which should help them identify this type of information easier.

Identifying reliable sources and determining if a source is biased is an important literacy that students must develop.  The Bad News game allows students to learn about disinformation in a unique and realistic way.
