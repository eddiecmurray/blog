With Mentimeter you can embed activities including multiple choice questions, word clouds, open ended questions, and scale questions into your presentations.  Participants respond by going to the the [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) website and entering a short code.

These are easy tools that teachers or professional developers can use with their audience to gather feedback and help direct the conversation in the classroom.  Since the participants do not need accounts it is great for quick audience participation during professional development.  Also, classroom teachers can use these as quick brainstorming tools during Do Now activties or as an exit ticket to assess student understanding.
