[Courtney Holden](https://twitter.com/CourtneyJHolden) at [5280](https://www.5280.com/) talks about [the InsideU web app which helps students understand and manage their emotions](https://www.5280.com/this-new-app-uses-the-characters-from-inside-out-to-help-little-coloradans-understand-their-biggest-feelings/):

>The InsideU Social Emotional Learning App, a collaboration between the Crown Wellness Institute and Pixar Animation Studios, uses scenes from Inside Out to help kids better understand their feelings and recognize they have a choice in how they react to them. “The more we start to layer on these experiences that your emotions—even your big ones—are understandable and acceptable,” Hubley says, “the more we are laying down a foundation for mental health and wellness.”

[InsideU](https://insideu.colorado.edu/) is a free web app designed for elementary and middle school students that offers a range of interactive and engaging activities to students navigate their emotions effectively.
