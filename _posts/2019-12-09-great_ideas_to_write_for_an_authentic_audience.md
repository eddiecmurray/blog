This year I have been supporting the New Media and Digital Journalism classes for high school students.  In both courses students focus on creating content using a variety of digital tools for authentic audiences.  Writing for authentic audiences is a great way for students to be more accountable for their published work.  Recently I found a great article that provides several project ideas when writing for an authentic audience.

[Angela Stockman](https://twitter.com/AngelaStockman) created an [incredible list with links to resources to help students write for authentic audiences](http://www.angelastockman.com/blog/2019/09/28/101-ways-young-writers-might-publish-for-an-authentic-audience/).  Some of my favorite ideas are below:

> 3. **Blogs** are still highly accessible. I’m told that all the cool kids hang out on Medium now. I’m trying, too. Teacher Ashley Bayles explains why this matters [here.](https://medium.com/synapse/why-i-want-my-students-to-write-on-medium-110ce0fc5a1d)

Blogs are a great way to have students document their learning.  [Edublogs](https://edublogs.org/) is a great tool that provides features to sort by tags, author, and categories.  On the class blog we use tags for topics (ie digital citizenship, bias, propaganda, digital well being, etc) and the categories to sort classes / school years.

> 8. **Memes** are funny, and that’s why they go viral. Kids love making and sharing them, too. [Sharon Serano shares good ideas and perspective here.](https://www.iste.org/explore/In-the-classroom/5-ways-to-use-memes-with-students) Mashable offers [six tools here.](https://mashable.com/2013/09/25/making-memes/)

[Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/)'s graphic tool is an easy way to create memes with images and texts.  Memes can be incorporated into blog posts as well.

> 18. **Comics and Cartoons** can be used to express information, arguments, and stories. And there are a bunch of digital tools that enable digital (and beautiful) design and social sharing. [Here are a bunch of tools and apps.](https://www.techlearning.com/tl-advisor-blog/11-comic-creation-web-tools-and-apps)

[Storyboard That](https://www.storyboardthat.com/) is an easy tool to create digital comics.  The free version allows you to create comics with up to six panels and you can create up to 3 comics a week.

> 20. **Podcasting** is hot, and kids enjoy making them. [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/) is a great place to begin.

Podcasting has exploded in popularity over the past few years.  There are great episodes from NPR on [Listenwise you can use an examples](https://www.eddiecmurray.com/blog/2018/12/14/listenwise_curates_educational_podcasts_for_teachers/).  Tools like [Soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/) (paid) and [BandLab](https://www.bandlab.com/) (free) make it easy for students to create podcasts.

> 25. **Book Trailers** are a blast to create, and writers could make them for their own work or for other books they’ve read. [Adobe Spark is great here, too.](https://spark.adobe.com/)

As Angela writes, [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/) is an easy to use tool to create videos.  For more advanced projects [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/) provides additional tools to make videos.

> 43. **Lists** (like this one) tend to appeal to wide, wide audiences. Writers can publish them across many platforms, for many purposes. [Here’s why list posts work and a few tips for creating a good one.](https://smartblogger.com/traffic-hack/)

Websites like [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/) are very popular for their list articles.  Having students create their own list articles is a great way to create content for an authentic audience.

> 65. **Take a Stand.** What’s unfair? Who is being harmed? Write a letter to the editor. Speak at an event. Rally.

Again, [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/) is a great tool for creating web pages, graphics, and videos about issues.  Adobe Spark videos also provide templates with prompts which are helpful for students.
