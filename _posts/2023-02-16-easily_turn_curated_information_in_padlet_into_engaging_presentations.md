Padlet is a powerful digital tool that can be used for a wide range of activities, including collaborative brainstorming, group discussions, interactive presentations, and multimedia projects. It also allows students to engage with each other and with the material in new and dynamic ways, by enabling them to share their thoughts, ideas, and perspectives in real-time.  Recently Padlet released a new feature that allows users to create presentations from the Padlet boards they create.

[Max Evans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-evans-a10005178/) on the [Padlet Blog](https://padlet.blog/slideshow/?utm_source=pocket_saves) explains how the new slideshow feature works:

> You add your content to a padlet, and you click the [slideshow] button. Like magic, you have a beautiful presentation.  Every post becomes a slide. The fonts are sized automatically. The colors are determined by your chosen wallpaper. You can navigate with your cursor or your keyboard. The presentation will be updated live when you edit the padlet it references.
