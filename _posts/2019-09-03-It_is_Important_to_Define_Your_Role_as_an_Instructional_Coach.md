During my first year as an educational technology specialist I found myself constantly clarifying what my role was to administrators and teachers.  Some teachers thought I was an administrator who was there to evaluate them, while others thought I was a technician who could fix their computer or printer.  It is important to clarify your role as an instructional coach to ensure teachers are able to utilize your skills.

[Joseph Kanke](https://twitter.com/j_kanke) discusses some [strategies for introducing yourself to administrators and teachers](https://blog.teachboost.com/how-to-introduce-yourself-as-a-coach):

>>A document that will be key to ongoing support is a "job description." The components of this document will give your position delimitations and provide those you support with a clear definition of what you actually do.

Kanke also explains that it is important for building level administrators to define your role and introduce you at faculty or team meetings.

>>Another way to create a connection is to have the leadership team introduce you at a whole staff meeting and explain their commitment to coaching, as support will go a long way in establishing a culture of a growth mindset.

One of the most important parts of being a successful instructional coach is building relationships with teachers.

>>I used the introductory letter to further demystify some of the common concerns new coaches hold, such as the fact that coaching is non-evaluative and confidential. I also included a paragraph about my experience as an educator, emphasizing my classroom experience, and a final paragraph about my hobbies and interests.

These strategies will help to properly define your role as an instructional coach and begin to develop a level of trust with the teachers you will work with.
