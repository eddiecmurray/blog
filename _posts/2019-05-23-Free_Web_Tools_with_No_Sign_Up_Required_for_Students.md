Sometimes you need a tool for a specific lesson or activity that you aren’t likely to use that often.  The time it takes for students to sign up and then remember the username/password for the few times you need it creates a barrier for using that tool.  In these situations it is easier to use tools that do not require students to create an account.

[Nathan Hall](http://twitter.com/nathanghall) has [created an exhaustive list of different technology tools](https://nathanghall.wordpress.com/webtools-no-registration-needed-for-students/) that have can be used for lesson or activities that don’t require students to create an account.  Some of my favorites on the list include: [Padlet](https://padlet.com/) (digital corkboard tool), [Bounce](https://bounceapp.com/) (image annotation tool), and [Graph.tk](http://graph.tk/) (mathematical graph creator).

All of these tools make it easy for students to focus on the task in the lesson rather than creating and managing multiple accounts.
