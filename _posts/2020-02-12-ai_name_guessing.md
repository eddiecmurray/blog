[This is an interesting project](https://flowingdata.com/2020/01/21/name-guess/) using artificial intelligence and data from the Social Security Administration to guess someone's name.  Enter your sex and the decade you were born then start to type your name to see how many guesses before the web app can figure out your name.  Here is more from the creator:

>This is based on data from the Social Security Administration, up to 2018. It’s relatively comprehensive, but there are a few limitations. First, it’s data for the United States, so the numbers don’t really apply elsewhere. Second, the SSA doesn’t include names with fewer than five people in a year, so the chart doesn’t cover more unique names. Third, there were no Social Security Numbers before 1935, so the name counts are fuzzier for years before that.

>Before you enter anything, the chart shows the most popular names for the given sex and decade. Then as you enter a name, the chart shows conditional probabilities. The more information you give it, the stronger the guess.
