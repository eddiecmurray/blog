[MisinfoDay](https://www.cip.uw.edu/misinfoday/) was established to educate high school students, educators, and librarians with media literacy skills to critically evaluate online content.  Created by the Center for an Informed Public at the University of Washington, the purpose of the annual March event is to help participants make well-informed judgments about the credibility of information found on the web.

The MisinfoDay page [contains resources to help educators incorporate these ideas in their classroom](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jW4dsfnnhP-yymf0qAZQscoaXVEC3ewxQHZGxHiIC9E/edit).  One of the lesson focuses on [The Types of Misinformation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12pzgk8qjczCS9B8q_fMHcxlnxCdaTArx/edit#slide=id.p1):

>This lesson, developed by CIP scholars and staff, helps students recognize false information when they see it by providing an introduction to mis- and disinformation, the difference between the two, and the seven types they may see on their social media feed.

Providing students and educators with media literacy skills will improve their capacity to assess the credibility of information available on the internet.
