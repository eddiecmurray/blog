[Yuvraj Chandra](https://twitter.com/YuvrajChandra21) at [MakeUseOf](https://www.makeuseof.com/) shared a [cheat sheet of Google search operators](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-google-search-tips-pdf) that can be used to narrow down search results.  It includes commands to help users filter results by site, timelines, and context.  The cheat sheet is available as a downloadable PDF from the webpage.

I use the following search operators on a daily basis:

| Purpose                                                                               | Syntax                   | Example                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Excludes search results that include this term.                                       | [term 1] -[term 2]       | best tablets -drawing     |
| Returns search results that include all terms within quotes in the exact given order. | "[term]"                 | "never gonna give you up" |
| Returns only search results that match a particular file extension.                   | [term] filetype:[format] | sleep study filetype:pdf  |

Students who know how to use search engine operators can save time and find the information they need more quickly.  For example, a student who is looking for information about the American Revolution can use the site: operator to limit their search to results from the History Channel website. Or, a student who is looking for a specific file type, such as a PDF, can use the filetype: operator to find only results that match that file type.  Learning how to use search engine operators is a valuable skill for students of all ages. It can help them find the information they need more quickly and easily, which can save them time and frustration.
