My name is Ed Murray.  I am an educational technology specialist in a school district on Long Island, NY.  I work with educators throughout the district to support the use instructional technology in the classroom.  This includes helping teachers with instructional planning, co-teaching or modeling the use of instructional technology in the classroom, and facilitating professional development workshops.

I also teach an introductory computer science class to middle school students.  We use using the engineering design process to create web apps using Javascript and physical computing project using Ardiuno.

When I'm not in school, you can typically find me training and competing in road races.  I've spent the last few years focuing on some bucket list races - the NYC Marathon and the Boston Marathon.
