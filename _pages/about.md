My name is Ed Murray.  I am an Educational Technology Specialist in a school district on Long Island, NY.  I work with educators throughout the district to support the use instructional technology in the classroom.  This includes helping teachers with instructional planning, co-teaching or modeling the use of instructional technology in the classroom, and facilitating professional development workshops.

I also teach an introductory coding class to 8th grade students.  We use Scratch to learn about computer programing by build projects that focus on digital storytelling and video games.  We also explore computer science topics and recently created a podcast ([Coding Lab EDU](https://anchor.fm/mrmurrayedu)) focusing on computer science careers.

When I'm not in school, you can typically find me training and competing in road races.  I've spent the last few years focuing on some bucket list races - the NYC Marathon and the Boston Marathon.
